          The ocean and I broke up some time ago. She left this tucked near my door. I don’t know when she stopped by or how long it had been there. I don’t know how to reach her. I know where she is, but not how to reach her.  I am not sure I will ever know.

        Cara,</br>
      </p>
      <p>
      How could you. How could you, how could you, how could you.
      </p>
      <p>
      How could you march all those men onstage and gift them millions, while I live without a home.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could you act so hurtful towards me, cementing your role in this boys club, filled with narcissists who assaulted me. How could you take and raise my child like I am just a trope to be consumed. How could you live like that and not give a shit to what I am going through. Never reach out to me, never support me.
      </p>
      <p>
      Raise our child without me in her life. Without her even knowing I exist. How could you sweep me under the rug like I’m an embarrassing dust pile of your secret and distant behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
      How could you wipe me, the real me out of your life, and keep this sad trope of who I am like a fairy tale to tell to people. Like I was poisoned and gone mad, locked away from the world. When I am sane but any words I share make me insane.
      </p>
      <p>
      It used to be everyday I would wake up without any one reaching out was like compound interest of pain in my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
      Then I realized you were never coming.
      </p>
      <p>
      Then I realized I didn’t exist to you, and that I never had.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I started to forget the pain you caused, on purpose, intentionally. I started to forget what I thought we had.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then I had the eyes to see what we were, what I am to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t want to forgive you, because that means I am right about what I was to you. I’m not just throwing a tantrum over things, irrational and acting out. I’m not going to be comforted by you for overreacting, or gently walked through the ways that you were showing your love this whole time, that I was just too focused on the negativity to see.
      </p>
      <p>
      To forgive means that I’m right. I’m right, I’m right, I’m right and I’ve simply been consumed like a product and discarded again.
      </p>
      <p>
        It means you are like them. It means they will all be like you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And where is living in that world where love is like plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Used to be used, discarded without thought- now choking me of my future, my love like the systems I’m moving through keeps receiving these caskets of exploitation and there’s less room to move and I eat them and they become a part of me, and trap me, and confuse me. All my generations.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is not what love is, this is not what love is supposed to feel like. I can’t react in any way engrained in my DNA, and I can’t die, I can’t be reborn to a world where anything makes sense because you’ve killed the world I am trapped in, the world I live in and am reborn in.
      </p>
      <p>
      To face this pain, to face what you do to me. To acknowledge you’ve left me in this toxic world and will never contribute to what you caused, let alone what it looked like when you arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
      That you are the same as them, that you will not change, that you will never support me, that you will never know and if you did, you would make me feel too exposed for having these emotions. And that you don’t want to change.
      </p>
      <p
      I forgive you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love, </br>
      </p>
