        On a walk to catch the sunset, a long train cut me off from the sculpture park. I walked back to the boardwalk above the aquarium and watched some
        people capture a long release of the ferris wheel. On the corner facing away from the wheel, I stared down at the ground and below the vista of the 
        islands I found a letter, creased in the middle and resting at my feet.

      And you tortured to death for ashes and dust. Fear and pain stopping your heart, shock overcoming your mental state. Is that the whole of your experience? Your death? Is it the whole of everything I owe you, the final edit on the spreadsheet we curated between each other, having moved out of trauma and slavery, and never again trusting it’s all for the best - making sure each kept their support and contributed in a visible way, measured and accounted before the next careful step in trusting another human. 
      </p>
      <p>
      How could I now view that sacrifice? Is that what keeps me up? That you have forced me to borrow such a sum against the asset of our relationship. One that can never, never be repaid. 
Is that the rage I feel? Like you somehow managed to pay for dinner, or drinks and I will never venmo it right. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The antithesis of what our space, our hold, our effort was created off of. You overcame it, and it cost me you. I would have given up that progress, and you knew it. 
      </p>
      <p>
      And had you given up, given in, given what was asked by those single minded men I could repay you, or perhaps it would be you that was in my debt. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Denying their satisfaction, and denying mine. Sounds like you. 
      </p>
      <p>
      And it will sound like you for the rest of my life now, a contract never to be fulfilled, a hanging debt still existing long past your breath, still living, still holding, still being.
      </p>
      <p>
      I hold it like I resent it, but I know I can only resent it because you still somehow exist within it. 
How many more of us are there, might our numbers be dwindling? Always so independent- but missing a piece of the pack I was unchoosing to belong to. A fate I could never be lost to, a community resented but tied in. Like you, like me, like those that did that to us. An artery we grew from as we aged. Unable to kill it enough that we would never live, unable to heal it enough that we would never die. How circuitous, 
      </p>
      <p>
      It’s clear we were not to love each other in a way that worked this time. In a way that would be sustainable or reflected upon. So now I move forward without you and it feels like I could not have loved you while you were here and I can not love you while you are gone. Not love like that, not love like the songs or books or poems.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our love is a place in the deep, deep darkness of humanity. A piece broken off both of us by the same jagged knife, a piece that cannot be repaired. A missing that calls to others like it. 
In that lack, in that empty, in that darkness of what will never and can never grow.  
      </p>
      <p>
      I love you, without measure.
