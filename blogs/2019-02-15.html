         Walking around the p patch cottages in Belltown, watching the sleeping earth and quiet plants wait for their final burst to spring. In a wooden box was a clearly custom made strawberry pot. And in one of the outward turns of clay, where dirt should be I found a letter. Like it had been placed there to be lost in the compost.

      Linneaus, </br>
      <p>
       Like the pattern of a dress I am cut from the past of you. I don’t know what it is to love someone beyond you, someone unlike you. I really hope I don’t love someone like me. That nihilistic bullshit in my head has one voice too many.  I may have taken advantage of the situation that was in front of me, but I’m not like you. I don’t torture people to get what I want. 
      </p>

        They say the best songs are written by people who don’t experience the things they are writing about. Poor people write the best songs about money, lonely people write the best songs about love. 
      </p>
      <p>

Our love is a cold day while the planet warms. Our love is a physical act in the spiritual awakening of humankind. My love is the sun that rises. My love is the sun in the sky. 
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to think about it like global warming. I am cold, but global warming is real. You broke and abandoned me, but what is the greater good. What is the greater change. What source of love still exists for me. What love can I not feel but exists. Warming chaining warning the planet of it’s existence. How can I go on. Only this. 
      <p>
It snowed this month, more snow than the city had seen for years. Looking out my window I saw robins, puffed and sitting. Their trees bare but for the dozens of their bodies irregularity placed on the upward pushing branches. 
      </p>
      <p>
You exist in branches.  I am the robin hiding exposed in the snow. I weigh down your boughs, one of many. 
     </p>
      <p>
       The boy who saved you. The boy who could not save you. Could you place my face on his? Shine light through our images like we were the same.  Transposed like that, matching someone so unlike me in your life. Merged like that, shifted. Could you forgive me? 
        </p>
      <p>
        If we two males were to become the same one. If you could see us as facets of the same stone, and not the opposites in a spectrum. Would you stop hurting yourself then? Could worlds and paths unfold, side by side to eternity. Exponential, unfurling like a fern that grabs it’s tendrils first to the furthest reaches and then grows downward. In all the endless possibilities that expand, could you not see one in which I was human. 
        </p>
