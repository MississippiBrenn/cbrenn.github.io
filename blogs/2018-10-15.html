          There is an older woman on my walk home from work. She sits in one of the many green spaces. Some days we sit together, she tells me that she knew me before I was reborn. That in the life before this I was her age, and our lives held together. I don’t remember. She wrote a letter to that person she knew, that died before her. She asks me to give it to them.

      Achete, </br>
      <p>
        Could you have grown older in another dimension? Piercing this one to hold the splatter of my expression from the other side of it’s reality. And me, then, like an abomination, my essence clinging to the space time continuum when it should move forward in this time only, see in this only, touch in this only.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all the years that you were dead I imagined you here last night. Grown from childhood, no longer trapped in that prepubescent body, no longer the way I always see you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were stoic, like a man who had lived life. Unassuming and unexpectant in your gaze, but there was no glimmer of love or hope in it. How ironic to have been given life and to live without it’s spark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you reach over from some other memory I have, that lived out it’s own timeline? Birthing you into my consciousness such that if I saw you again, I would know you. A part of my mind where no one dies, and everyone grows old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds ironically terrible, ironically wonderful.
        Are you alive on some other shore? Experiencing time with another sun?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have children there? Do you grow old around holidays with warmth and compassion?
        Or are you trapped like me, in the fear of the expanse. At the very vastness of human consciousness and expression and paralyzed that it is all the same. I can’t say which is worse, only that neither is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        How I love you. In the pain I see in my own soul that I could hold for you. Perhaps that is unfair. To say how I could love you, what pain you carry. Perhaps that is why you stay in that other world, opposite in realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I could love you as I knew you. If I could know you as I love you.
        It would be a cruel joke and a forgiving kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see why now we couldn’t live together. Grow up, grow old, grow love together. Our days would have been a revolution of decomposition. The very fabric of the universe unravelling through our knitted fingers.
