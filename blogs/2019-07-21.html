          If you walk through the graveyard that hosts Bruce Lee, there's a white marker with a statue of a woman. Someone had placed this letter in her hand, extending to a passer by.

      Luna, </br>
      </p>
    <p>
I did love you, it wasn’t just for money. 
</p>
<p>
Now you hold that darkness inside of you, like it will extinguish the world if you breathe too deeply. Is that how you see me? A man overtaken by darkness. Unable to distinguish from the crushing humanity that surrounds him and the extinguished light residing inside. 
</p>
<p>
I was going to love you, I was going to marry you. We all were. And you ran away. 
What the fuck were you hoping to find out there.
</p>
<p> 
A community that loved you better? That knew you better? 
</p>
<p>
A love that knew your body better than the community that grew up with it, grew up healing and molding it? 
</p>
<p>
There are no walls to look past, there is no world beyond this. Just an empty waveless expanse.
Your destiny was here, your truth was here. I shared your writing without our family, with the world and you called me a thief. I brought you gods and immortals to lay with and you called me a pimp, a trafficker, a rapist.I held you while your world fell from the reveal of your life and you called me imprisoner. You said I wouldn’t give you what you want. Do you know how much you had. 
</p>
<p>
Your little rebellion paid off. Now your success and influence unmatched and we are simply the underside to a shadow that no one can touch or see. Even in your success the fear that you will be me is palpable. And striking that such a small matter could hold you, in your vastness.
</p>
<p>
Still afraid to be like me. And that is why you keep the lid so tight. Because what if you love someone the way I loved you. What if your love was my love, how would your little rebellion survive that. What would your support, your side, your army exist as after that.
You know, you know you are me. 
</p>
<p>
We are the dirt.The unloved, unwanted, abandoned, thrown away. Bastards.  
</p>
<p>
You can love, though, and love without fear. That is where our similarities end. You found a resonance in that emptiness, I pushed to fill it with the love of something else, anything, anyone. Any kind of love, even the love I had for you, child.
</p>
<p>
And you are not me, you don’t need to hold someone to get through your day. And our differences are you in purest form, why you will survive, why you rule and why you win. Why you are not scared of us, not scared of any of us. We need you. We need you more than disdain, more than the lies of superiority, more than life. 
</p>
<p>
You are the last real hope we have that there is real truth, real strength, a presence independent of this or any other bullshit world. We put that light out in you, and it goes out forever. 
</p>
<p>
Don’t wait to love until it’s anything, until it’s anyone. Even if that anyone was me. Don’t wait to love until it’s darkness.
</p>
<p>
Love,
</p>
<p> 
Persephone
