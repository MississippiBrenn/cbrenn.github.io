         I've watched Natalie Portman for so long. There is always a deeper presence in her performances not born from hardship or torture, the way that strong women are always portrayed. To be a heroine it seems you must be assaulted, you must be tortured, you must be raped. Her quiet strength and driving presence come from somewhere within, something that preceeds breaking, something that was there inherently, always as her.

      Natalie, </br>
      <p>
        I would like to thank you for starring in a film about the power of the receptive. It's a concept I've studied for sometime. My acceptance of it preculded by the intellectual patterns and mental exercises of the IChing, where energetic movements are neatly packaged into translated versus by white men who spent their lives as intelligent.
      </p>
      <p>
        That format, that package was the only way I felt comfortable approaching the feminine as a young woman. I suspect for many people who have never found that package, an approach to the feminine is unheard of, merely a gaping receptivity easily blamed. In it's very nature accepting, in it's nature undefended. What strength could lie there? Like a field easily plundered, or an open chest unguarded by a sharp spear. How are we as women to keep ourselves, to know ourselves, to want and value ourselves if what makes us women is so easily encroached, so easily compromised, so easily overwhelmed by the very action of interaction? To only be entered, where is the space for ourselves if we are only to receive. If our nature is acceptance, and by default compromise of some deeper jewel we have been led to believe is where our true identity lies, our true voice exists. If we are by design corruptible, how are we to find ourselves, what is before corruption? 
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is power in the receptive. There is strength in taking everything given and exalting it into it's true nature. There is identity in that. The earth takes all seeds, it receives rain, it receives fire, it receives wind, it receives animals and footsteps and humans and emptiness. And for many persepectives that is where it ends. Only seen is the imprint of what has happened and not the space behind it, the drive behind, within, around and in front of it. The invisible tie that what has or will or did imprint on the earth can only do so because of the earth. While it receives, what exists could not be without that reception. Would not be, would something before existence that is not capable of being defined. But the receptive knows what cannot be known as it knows itself.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The feminine, the receptive has an agenda much greater than conquest or defense or possession. And it accomplishes this totality with little effort, only growing off the energy and identity of those things flocking to it's seemingly inactive entrance. Like it is something to be conquered or possessed. It has no need of conquer, it has no need of possession. Why did you, that your beliefs and intent would hold in an environment immune to this domination. By existence it holds you, it is the receptive. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And it can be terrible, and destructive as it enables, nurtures, mutates, and merges what it receives. And it can be beautiful. 
      </p>
      <p>
       For your space in the world of the unashamedly and uncompromising feminine, I love you. For your fear in it's power, your disbelief in it's purpose, I love you. For the parts of yourself that you left to that presence like an offering when your entire existence was the altar, I love you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in strength added to my own I can move through the world, inherent in my nature, held in the reality that outside this reception between my legs, there is only larger reception that catches my feet. One that holds it's identity and power and past in spaces before definition and existence. That moves as if this moment of acceptance was it's last, first and only breath. One that swallows time as it swallows shadow. 
      </p>
      <p>
       As real as waking. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Love, </br>
        Cara
