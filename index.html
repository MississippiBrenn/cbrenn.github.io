  <p>
  Hi there :D</br>  
  In 2019 I completed Ada Developers Academy. I learned HTML/CSS Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and core industry concepts around pair programming, scrum, restful APIS, object oriented and test driven development.
  For my capstone I worked with nonSQL database to contribute to the shared Giveth codebase, and get it ready for production.</br>
 </p>
  <p>During my internship at Hulu in iOS Playback I worked on a number of front and back end bugs. Contributing significantly to reducing tech debt of bugs that were older than 100 days. Front end bugs included scroll views, stacking, and parent- child view controller relationships.
  Back end tickets included calls out to external APIs, metrics and user hits via our internal instrumentation team, documenting and working with the ad lifecycle.
 </p> 
<p>
Outside of programming, I keep up on my Mandarin(非常喜欢认识您们!), search for murals around Seattle, and study dance and pilates!
</br>
 I want to inspire other women and vulnerable people who have struggled with homelessness and/or trafficking. Know that your life can improve no matter what you have come through!
</br>
 Look forward to talking with you!
</br>
