  <p>Hi! I'm Mississippi Brennan, a full stack dev located in Seattle.</br>
  Recently I completed Ada Developers Academy where I learned React, rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and ruby. Also more general core concepts around pair programming, scrum, restful APIS, object oriented and test driven development.
  </br>
  During my internship at Hulu iOS I worked on a number of front and back end bugs. Contributing significantly to reducing tech debt of bugs that were older than 100 days. Front end bugs included scroll views, stacking, and parent- child view controller relationships.
  </br> 
   Back end tickets included calls out to external APIs, metrics and user hits via our internal instrumentation team, documenting and working with the ad lifecycle.
  </br> 
<p>  
Outside of programming, I keep up on my Mandarin(非常喜欢认识您们, search for murals around Seattle, and study dance and pilates!
</p>
<p> I want to inspire other women and vulnerable people who have come from homelessness and/or trafficking. Know that your life can be amazing no matter what you have come through!
</p>
 <p>Look forward to talking with you!
   </p>
